# Single Screen App

Udacity - Android Basics: User Interface

Final project

## Project Overview

To test your skills from this free course, design and implement a single screen app that displays information about a fictional small business. Think along the lines of your favorite coffeeshop, local restaurant, or that gem of a store that sells those rare comic books or records.

## Requirements

Your design must include:

* Business name
* At least one photo representing the business
* Two or more other pieces of information, such as:
  * Contact information for the business (eg phone number, email address, website)
  * Address of the Business
  * Description of business
  * Hours of operation
  
Note: This is not required but If youâ€™re up for a making real impact in your community, go check out an actual local business and obtain their consent to build an app for them!
